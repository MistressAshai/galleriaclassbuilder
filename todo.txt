x add a clear button
x add a "now that you've gotten all the skills you want, you need to soul transfer to the same
  class X number of times to have enough skill points to use all your desired skills" indicator on
  skill point screen
click on facet names from left tables to "quick change" target facet (so don't have to cycle to get to it)
x clean up ui
clean up code (comments, using maps when cleaner to use arrays, etc)
x correct skill mistranslations by updating the correctedDescription fields (https://redd.it/11j57pf)
x make sure alt classes with innate skill are ordered correctly AFTER other < level 99 soul transfer classes in the route
add a new "Mode: Automatic" that chooses the best facet for the skills you've chosen (least amount of skill cost)
add skill CLASS discount costs for the remaining 3 skills (cost 28, 53 and 70 skills) in skill-cost.json
figure out what level skills are learned for each facet, and if any level variance exists post-soul transfer
