soul clarity determines skill points
+1 skill point per soul clarity increase
    soul clarity 1 (initial) - 40 skill points
    soul clarity 2 - 41 skill points
    soul clarity 4 - 44 skill points
    etc (see table below)


Skill Point Caps/Increases
    Base	                        40
    Soul Clarity 2-99               +1-98
    First Witch Petition	        +10 (adds 1 star to skill screen)
    Pre-Grand Cathedral Total Cap	148
    Soul Clarity 100-999	        +1-90 (+1 every 10 levels)
    Second Witch Petition	        +30 (adds second star to skill screen)
    Grand Cathedral Total Cap	    268

skill acquire levels
    skills are learned in order from top to bottom at the following levels: 4, 8, 12, 17, 22, 28, 34, 41, 48, 56, 63, 72, 81
      after soul transferring, these levels can vary some.  still not sure what determines the variance
    so, 0 + (4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 9, 9)
    choosing your "free" skill just means that at the level you would have learned the skill, nothing happens
      (since you already have it)

soul transfer skills 
    still need to be lvl 99 for unique skills transfer 
    selected skill during puppet craft now counts as a unique skill, therefore it's best to
      NOT choose it if you want to transfer it early (pre lvl 99)
    once you acquire a skill via soul transfer, you can never lose it
        for example, if you soul transfer a peer fortress at level 99, you get its unique skills carried over
        if you were to then soul transfer again but at level 1, you would still keep all the skills you've learned,
          including the peer fortress's unique skills


Skill Point Cost Discounts
    UNIQUE: unique skills -> 100% discount (no cost)
    INITIAL: skills starting class learned -> 75% discount
    CLASS: skills learned by current class -> 66% discount
    NONE: skills that don't fit any of the other criteria -> 0% discount (full price)
    formula -> discountedCost = cost - Math.floor(cost * discountPercentage)

alike exclude skills belong to a category of similar skills that do not stack and cannot even be applied at the same time
